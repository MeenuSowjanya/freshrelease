## Helloüñê ! Welcome to [ZUPP](https://zupp-ticket-app-test.herokuapp.com/)

##### I am Meenu Sowjanya and this is my project , ZUPP, An Internal Service Management Software from Freshworks to provide a delightful employee experience.

## Technical Challenges faced and Resolution
### 1. Cloning a ticket
    Problem statement :
    Cloning content was easy , but cloning the images or the files attached to the parent ticket was tough. 
    The input field's datatype of new ticket should be in blob, but the return type from the parent ticket was in binary. 
    
    Solution :
    I referred Active Storage module, and found the ".blobs" extension.  It returned the blob version of the attachments.
    
### 2. Replicating 'public_activity' gem
    Problem statement :
    'public_activity' gem is used to track the Activity log of models. I wished to do the activity log manually. 
     The involvement of many models for tracking the CRUD activities was little complicated to handle.
    
    Solution :
    I referred the Schema of the 'public_activity' gem and designed an EER Diagram for Create, Delete and Update Activities.
    Later, I managed to handle many models.
    
    Extra implementation :
    I could also get the log of a Model before updation and after updation and could display the from status and to status.
